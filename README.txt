**Money Laundering Transaction Identification using Decision Tree and Random Forest Classifiers**

**Overview**
This repository contains the code and documentation for a project focused on the analysis and recognition of money laundering and illicit transactions within a comprehensive financial transaction database. The primary goal of the project was to develop a robust classification model capable of identifying money laundering transactions within the database by leveraging decision tree classifiers and random forest algorithms.

**Project Structure**

**Dataset Description**
Provides an overview of the "IBM Transactions for Anti Money Laundering" dataset, including its classification and characteristics.

**Data Exploration**
Details the analysis of the dataset to understand the patterns and characteristics of the transactions.

**Preprocessing and Feature Engineering**
Describes the process of transforming the dataset into a more suitable configuration, including handling outliers, encoding categorical variables, and feature selection.

**Model Implementation**
Discusses the development and testing of decision tree and random forest classifiers, including hyperparameter tuning and model evaluation.

**Model Evaluation and Analysis of Results**
Explores the evaluation metrics used to optimize the classifier's ability to assign correct labels to each data frame, with a focus on minimizing false negatives.

**Cost Model for Money Laundering Problem**
Details the cost model developed to quantify the improvements achieved by the random forest classifier in reducing the bank's cost related to identifying illicit transactions.

**Key Findings**
The random forest model demonstrated significant improvements over the baseline, reducing the bank's cost in identifying illicit transactions. The project prioritized maximizing the Recall metric to minimize the number of false negatives, aligning with the institution's foremost priority.

**Repository Contents**

**Code**
Contains the Python code for implementing decision tree and random forest classifiers, along with data preprocessing and model evaluation.

**Documentation**
Includes detailed explanations of the dataset, data exploration, preprocessing steps, and model implementation.

**Results**
Provides insights into the performance of the models and their impact on reducing the financial burden of handling illicit transactions for financial institutions.

**Conclusion**
The project showcases the effectiveness of decision tree and random forest classifiers in identifying money laundering transactions and minimizing the cost to the bank. The results offer valuable insights into the performance of the models and their potential to reduce the financial burden of handling illicit transactions for financial institutions.
